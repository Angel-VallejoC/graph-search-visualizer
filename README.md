## About
This is a simple Java GUI made to demonstrate
how Depth First Search (DFS) and Breath First Search (BFS) graph
searching techniques work.

* Left click on a cell to select/deselect it as a prohibited cell,
a prohibited cell cannot be used to find a path between the start
and end point
* Right click on a cell to select/deselect it as a start/end point,
* Click on the dropdown field to select between DFS and BFS
* Click the Start button to start searching a path from start point
to end point
* After searching, click clear button to make the grid look like it 
looked before searching
* Click on reset button to set the grid to its initial state
